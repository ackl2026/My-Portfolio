            <h2>Investment Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                Buying and holding for the long term (5-10 years). Good compounding businesses with wide moat or highly difficult to be replaced. Never buy out of FOMO or follow the herd mentality. To be disciplined and unemotional towards overall market sentiment as long as fundamentals of the business are intact.
            </p>

            <h2>Stock Selection</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Monopolistic</li>
                <li>Have Pricing Power</li>
                <li>Has Operating Leverage</li>
                <li>Has Organic Growth</li>
                <li>Good Management</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How Portfolio is Managed</h2>
            <p>
                Buy when good businesses selected are trading at an extreme discount or below fair value. Do not sacrifice the quality of the business for any low valuations. Sell only when we made a mistake on the initial thesis or when there is a better business with higher return with lower downside compared to the ones in holding.

                <p class="description">
                    Mapletree Logistics Trust (MLT) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that focuses on owning and managing logistics assets across the Asia-Pacific region with total of S$13.4 billion Assets Under Management (AUM) as of June 30 2024.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Investment Thesis</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The revenue is diversified throughout multiple regions.</li>
                    <li>Gross revenue & Net Property Income has been slightly stagnant due to macro headwind (I.E. Interest Rates and the Economy in China).</li>
                    <li>The management team has managed to divest assets at higher valuation and also actively acquire assets.</li>
                    <li>As of June 30 2024, debt maturity for FY24/25 is at $197M which is only 3%. It is favorable as interest rates will be coming down based on current news as of 29 July 2024.</li>
                    <li>83% Debt are hedged at fixed interest rates.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Risk and Opportunities</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>(Risk) Management has highlighted that the current China Economy is not doing too well and there is oversupply of Logistics space in China, therefore rental revisions and income generated will be on the downtrend.</li>
                    <li>(Risk) The REIT might not do as well as compared to other REITs to consider such as Capitaland Acendas REIT.</li>
                    <li>(Opportunity) DPU is expected to be lower, however the current share price has dipped and is now sitting at a 6.77% dividend yield.</li>
                    <li>(Opportunity) As a long term investor, buying at the current level looks good as long as the management continues to focus on portfolio rejuvanation and prudent capital management.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Most of the properties owned is in Singapore therefore the command of revenue is higher due to limited space singapore has.</li>
                    <li>Fundamentals of the company is quite sound even though there are headwinds of interest rates and companies facing workers demanding for work from home days.</li>
                    <li>Interest rates remains elevated, a downshift in interest rates will be tailwind for REITS industry.</li>
                    <li>With the current price of $1.98 as of write up, target accumulate price is at $1.95.</li>
                    <li>Portfolio occupancy dropped slightly due to acquisition of ION Orchard.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>(Risk) Frankfurt office leasing market remains challenging with rental activity largely in the 1,000 – 3,000 sqm segment, exemplifying tendency towards downsizing and enhanced focus on location and quality.</li>
                    <li>(Risk) Office revenue continues to decline, however missing gallileo revenue due to AEI.</li>
                    <li>(Opportunity) 81% borrowing is on fixed rate.</li>
                    <li>(Opportunity) Higher rental reversions for retail and office.</li>
                    <li>(Opportunity) Most AEI will be completed by the end of 2025.</li>
                    <li>(Opportunity) Fundamentals remain strong since 2021, reflecting strong management execution.</li>

                <p class="description">
                    NetLink NBN Trust’s extensive network forms the backbone of Singapore’s Nationwide Broadband Network (NBN), delivering ultra-high-speed internet access across mainland Singapore and its connected islands. NetLink NBN Trust and its subsidiaries (“NetLink”), designs, constructs, and maintains the passive fibre infrastructure, including ducts, manholes, fibre cables, and Central Offices, vital to the NBN’s operation.
                </p>

                <h4>Investment Thesis</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Netlink's is the sole provider of singapore's broadband network thus the moat of this business is quite strong. This business is viewed similar to REIT where it pays out 90% of its cash to unit holders.</li>
                    <li>Overall gross revenue has been increasing, 2024 net income is lower due to one-off payments.</li>
                    <li>Most of the product segments are growing except for Ducts and manhole, Ancillary project (which was said its seasonal based on contract) and Co-location.</li>
                    <li>86% of the company's pricing is regulated which provides a steady stream of income.</li>
                    <li>In 2024, the government has increased the regulated pricing for the next 5 years which means we will be looking at higher steady revenue till 2029.</li>
                    <li>Management has stated that their fibre optics can provide 10Gbps connection or higher which scales easily with the nationwide push to increase higher bandwith and connection speed.</li>
                    <li>The government has also announced that they will be spending 100million to support the enhancement of the country's broadband speed, and Netlink is positioned well to capture this opportunity.</li>
                    <li>Debt profile is at 20% leverage with roughly 75-80% of their debt is hegded at low interest rate.</li>
                    <li>The expenses are increasing year to year which could be a ratio to look at so that it doesnt eat into the overall bottom line of the company.</li>
                    <li>DPU has been rising yearly which is a good sign in line with Revenue.</li>
                    <li>At the current writing the Yield is at 5.89% with a price of $0.895 per unit.</li>
                    <li>Overall, it is a solid company with good management and has good moat and some tailwind for the near future.</li>

                    IRIET Global is a pure play Western European Focused-REIT. They invest in real estate used primarily for office, retail and industrial (including logistics). They have assets in Germany, France and Spain with a total AUM of $855.6m Euros.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Investment Thesis</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gross revenue is one the rise year on year so as net property income. But the DPU has been on the decline. It is due to rising interest rates, tax and finance cost.</li>
                    <li>Portfolio occupancy took a dip in 2022 due to a huge tenant leaving but has slightly recovered since.</li>
                    <li>The share price is very low now which provides a window of opportunity to buy in and wait for the recovery, the management has proved to be prudent in managing the assets.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Risk and Opportunities</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>(Risk) They have recently announced that a major tenant in Germany will not be renewing their lease and will end at December 2024.</li>
                    <li>(Risk) Management has said that they will start AEI to the building to attract more tenants and is currently looking for future tenants.</li>
                    <li>(Risk) The overall economy in the eurozone is still a headwind with high interest rates but is expecting to come down as US reduces interest rates.</li>
                    <li>(Opportunity) The yield is still high and it might be worth to purchase the REIT while waiting for recovery.</li>
                    <li>(Opportunity) Recent 2024 1H reports was positive but need to consider upfront payment from the tenant which is not renewing their lease end of December 2024.</li>
                    <li>(Opportunity) The debt profile is quite favorable with none due for refinance till 2026.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Keppel DC has achieved good rental revision for the year 2024. Including their acquisitions of Japan data center and 2 other data centers plus 1 divestment, they managed to increase Gross Revenue, NPI and also DPU.</li>
                    <li>Portfolio occupancy has dipped with the acquisition, however it looks like theres room to grow thei revenue by acheiving higher occupancy rate.</li>
                    <li>Leverage ratio has also decreased significantly due to equity fund raising and preferential offering.</li>
                    <li>Their fixed loans stands at 66% which is quite unfavorable as compared to Digital Core REIT at 86% fixed loans or Mapltree Industiral Trusts at 78.3%.</li>
                    <li>The outlook for data centres continues to be positive as hyperscalers around the world is looking for more expansion for data centres to power their AI goals.</li>
                    <li>Coupled with a strong sponsor Keppel, the company is in a good position to increase their AUM.</li>
                    <li>Current price of $2.06 yields 4.54% dividend which may not be much of a buy as there are other similar asset classes yielding 5-6% yield.</li>
                    <li>Would consider if the yield comes back to 5% and above.</li>

                    <li>For year 2024, Apple has increased their free cash flor and Gross Revenue, stock based compensation continues to be on the rise which is something to note. The company continues to buyback shares which increases the value of current shareholder.</li>
                    <li>The company has seen an uptick in sales of their products due to the launch of Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence will be expanding to more countries in April 2025 which may spur another cycle of product upgrades.</li>
                    <li>It is already evident that sales in countries which Apple Intelligence is available were higher than countries which that did not have Apple Intelligence.</li>
                    <li>The company continue to bring Apple Vision Pro to more countries which they have yet to be released.</li>
                    <li>Apple Vision Pro was used in the production of the movie Wicked which was a successful hit in December 2024.</li>
                    <li>Recently, Apple has also announced that Alibaba will be their partner to bring AI into their Iphones in China. Although this has yet to playout, it may be a potential upgrade cycle for the lagging revenue from this region.</li>
                    <li>Many investors are pessimistic on the growth of apple and has since trimmed or removed their position from their portfolio, however the company still stands as an anchor to much portfolios in ETF's.</li>
                    <li>The company's growth is slower than other big tech's, but it would be good to add into position should there be a pullback in stock price to a fair value or undervalued range.</li>

                    Google is mostly known for their search engine, but they generate income through advertisements, google play, android system, pixel phones, cloud (such as gmail, workspace, docs, and drive), and other bets (Waymo a self driving cars unit, Verily a life science unit).

                <h4>Investment Thesis</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Google had a double digit revenue growth in 2024 which is good for a 2 Trillion market cap company. Overall segment has seen growth with Subscriptions and Cloud leading the way.</li>
                    <li>Stock based comp has slowed down slightly and they have bought back shares which increases shareholder value.</li>
                    <li>Google have implemented Gemini and other AI products across all suite of their product which increased in customer demand for google cloud as they consume 8 times more compute than they have 18 months ago.</li>
                    <li>Youtube continue to be the strongest streaming tool used by everyone.</li>
                    <li>Waymo continues to expand throughout US and has increased trips.</li>
                    <li>Google has mentioned that they have a backlog of demand and have insufficient capacity to supply to the demand, thus have increased the CapEX for 2025 to meet those demand.</li>
                    <li>With AI intregration throughout all of their product, Google has assisted many enterprises in reducing cost and improving efficiency. This trend will continue as long as AI products continue to evolve.</li>
                    <li>Google remains at a good valuation compared to its peers in the same industry, there's alot of media attention driving down the share price.</li>
                    <li>As the fundamentals grow, the share price will eventually catch up to its intrinsic value.</li>
                    <li>Due to the demand and double digit growth, a tradedown will provide an opportunity to buy into Google.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Adobe's product is widely used amongst content creators and businesses. Their revenue is hugely subscription based and is able to have a consistent gross revenue throughout the years as evident in key figures.</li>
                    <li>Total Performance Obligation continue to rise signalling good demand.</li>
                    <li>The management has seen increased demand in their products with AI Integration. They will continue to leverage on AI capabilities to increase their offerings and productivity.</li>
                    <li>Despite the noise of increasing competition, Adobe has still been able to grow their revenue quarter to quarter at a double digit percentage.</li>
                    <li>Overall, the drop in share price was seen unwarrented and poses as an opportunity to accumulate more shares.</li>
                    <li>Adobe has also aggresively bought back shares during this period.</li>
                    <li>AI will continue to drive revenue for companies which have already established themselves. I think Adobe is in the right place to capture the demand and continue to grow for years to come.</li>

                    Palantir’s business revolves around providing software platforms that help organizations integrate, analyze, and visualize large amounts of data. Their primary clients include government agencies, international organizations, and private companies. Their 4 platforms are Gotham, Foundry, AIP and Apollo.

                <h4>Investment Thesis</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Palantir was founded in 2003, they were primarily focused on building software for the intelligence community (Governments). They have since expanded to commercial enterprises.</li>
                    <li>Their latest product is AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform) which uses LLM to merge with the enterprise data to provide optimum solution.</li>
                    <li>They have continued to show significant growth in 2024. The revenue guidance for 2025 is also very high compared to previous years, this may be due to the amount of Remaining Deal Value they have.</li>
                    <li>The risk is that if they are unable to actualise these remaining value, then they will fall short of their estimates.</li>
                    <li>The company has also stick to its Rule of 40, and exceeded this rule to 81% in Q4 2024.</li>
                    <li>Total revenue growth is at 30% Year over Year but this growth may not last for the next 5 years, a 15-20% growth in the next 5 to 10 years may be of a more realistic expectation.</li>
                    <li>As a growing company will increase its stock based compensation and expenses. As long as the revenue and free cash flow can justify their spending the risk is lower.</li>
                    <li>As of March 2025, Palantir sits at a very lofty valuation with every multiple being too high.</li>
                    <li>Company continues to grow at a rapid pace and the share price will eventually meet its intrinsic value. A caution would be not to enter when a company's valuation is lofty.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Salesforce in 2024 has continued to grow revenue at around 10% and is guiding a 7-8% growth year over year. Usually they will always beat their guidance.</li>
                    <li>However, even though as they guide lower the CEO Mark Benioff is focused on expanding Free Cash Flow and Operating Margins of the company.</li>
                    <li>Growth in product segments continue to rise at around 10% year over year.</li>
                    <li>In 2025, they will be performing heavy marketing on their Agent Force. Agent Force are Agentic AI which improves the overall workflow and efficiency of the company.</li>
                    <li>CEO has mentioned in the earnings call that demand is strong as Agent Force has shown to be benificial for companies. He is a strong beleiver of a digital workforce.</li>
                    <li>Total RPO (Performance Obligations) is at $63.4B which is 11% higher Y-O-Y. This signifies that they still have a wide Moat in the CRM business and will continue to grow with AI adoption.</li>
                    <li>They recently have a leadership transition by combining CFO and COO together which may not be much of a risk as long as Mark is still CEO of the company.</li>
                    <li>As long as the company can continue to grow at a low double digit percentage, it is a good company to buy in when the valuation is right.</li>
